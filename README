March 25 2004 README addition from VJ Carey:
This is an R package for access to Wolfgang's contributed
kidney data.  I have just used save(compress=TRUE) for some
of the data, and added some trivial documentation.  inst/archive
includes Wolfgang's audit notes.

==========BELOW IS ORIGINAL README CONTENT=============
eset74.rda
==========
"eset": exprSet with 4224 genes and 74 samples (renal cell cancers).
Normalized with vsn.
The most interesting pheno-variables are
- Subtype
- rf.survival, progress
- survival.time, died
- and the genetic aberrations

cloneanno.rda
=============
clone annotations. data.frame with 4224 rows 
(yeah, I know, it should be an annotation package...)
> colnames(cloneanno)
 [1] "plate"        "SrcRow"       "SrcCol"       "imageid"      "AccNumber"
 [6] "spot1"        "spot2"        "description"  "vendor"       "chromosome"
[11] "llchromosome" "cytoband"


For the raw data and the preprocessing:

qua.rda  
=======
Raw data. Matrix with dim(8704, 4, 175), that is 8704 spots, 4 spot 
statistics, 175 chips       
dimnames(qua)[[2]]
1] "fg.green" "bg.green" "fg.red"   "bg.red"

spotanno.rda 
============
Spot annotation. data.frame with 8704 rows
colnames(spotanno)
[1] "Block"     "Row"       "Column"    "AccNumber" "Name"      "SrcPlt"
[7] "SrcRow"    "SrcCol"    "vendor"    "ImageID"   "probe"

hybanno.rda
===========
Chip annotation. data.frame with 175 rows
colnames(hybanno)
[1] "filename"  "patientid" "slideid"
